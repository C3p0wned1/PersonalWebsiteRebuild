    <p class = "parastyles">First things first welcome to my website! My name is Josiah Bennett and this is my personal portfolio. I 
        am an IT professional with experience in desktop support and system administration.  I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh
        with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems and Technology.

        On this website I will feature many of projects that I work on in my free time. Other important information such
        as how to contact me and my updated resume are also available.  Web development is something that I find very enjoyable.
        Since I feel the best way to learn anything is by jumping in and playing with the thing you're trying to learn.  As such 
        this site will also be a way for me to improve my web development skills.  From time to time new features will be added to
        test new methods of adding functionality that I am learning.
