                    On this website I will feature many of projects that I work on in my free time. Other important information such as how to contact me and my updated resume are also available. Web development is something that I find very enjoyable. Since I feel the best way to learn anything is by jumping in and playing with the thing you're trying to learn. As such this site will also be a way for me to improve my web development skills. From time to time new features will be added to test new methods of adding functionality that I am learning.
